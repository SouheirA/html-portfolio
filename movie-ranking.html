<h1>The Best Movies According to Souheir</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Manifest</h3>
<p> 
Manifest is a great series where a whole plan disappears and comes back again 7 years later.<br  />
The passengers of the plan start to get visions which makes them stand out alot.
</p>
<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>
    Stranger things is about kids beating the way of a second world. One of the kids is a runaway from a lab and she has the ability to control stuff with her mind.
</p>
<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>
    Money Heist has a very smart plot and its protaginst is hotly smart too. It's not the usual rob a bank or a jewelry heist. It's about robbing the money making place in Spain.
